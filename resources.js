<p data-start="197" data-end="223"><strong>It started with fatigue.</strong></p>
<p data-start="225" data-end="327">Not the kind that comes after a long day, but the deep, lingering tiredness that refuses to go away.</p>
<p data-start="329" data-end="580">For months, Kunle felt drained. He worked hard, slept late, and survived mostly on fast food and sugary drinks. Meals were something to silence hunger, not something to think about. Getting sick often felt normal, and being tired became a lifestyle.</p>
<p data-start="582" data-end="899">One evening, while visiting his aunt in the village, Kunle noticed something different. The people woke up early, worked under the sun, and yet looked strong and energetic. His aunt, Aunty Bisi, spent most of her time in the kitchen, preparing simple meals from vegetables, grains, legumes, fruits, and clean water.</p>
<p data-start="901" data-end="938">Kunle asked her what her secret is.</p>
<p data-start="940" data-end="989">She laughed and pointed to the pot on the fire.</p>
<p data-start="991" data-end="1046">&ldquo;This is it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Food is the first medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-start="1048" data-end="1393">Aunty Bisi explained how every meal plays a role in the body. Vegetables help fight diseases quietly. Fruits strengthen the immune system. Proteins rebuild the body after stress and labor. Whole grains provide lasting energy, not the quick highs that fade into weakness. Even water, she said, is the silent worker that keeps everything moving.</p>
<p data-start="1395" data-end="1695">At first, Kunle thought it sounded too simple. How could food do what medicine struggles to fix? But after a week of eating balanced meals less oil, more vegetables, natural foods, and proper portions he felt lighter. His sleep improved. His mind felt clearer. His energy returned without caffeine.</p>
<p data-start="1697" data-end="1949">Back in the city, Kunle made small changes. He didn&rsquo;t abandon his favorite foods; he simply balanced them. He added fruits to his mornings, vegetables to his meals, drank more water, and reduced processed foods. The changes were gradual but powerful.</p>
<p data-start="1951" data-end="2088">Months later, he realized something important: good health wasn&rsquo;t found in a pharmacy alone. It was built daily, quietly, on the plate.</p>
<p data-start="2090" data-end="2274">Nutrition did not promise perfection or immunity from illness. Instead, it offered strength, resilience, and balance. It helped the body heal faster, think better, and live stronger.</p>
<p data-start="2276" data-end="2496">Kunle now shares his story often, not as a doctor or expert, but as someone who learned that good health begins with everyday choices. Because long before illness shows up, the body is already listening to what we eat.</p>
<p data-start="2498" data-end="2546">And in that truth lies the power of nutrition.</p>

        summary:
            "This article explains how daily food choices shape gut health, immunity, and overall wellbeing. It explores the role of the gut microbiome, highlights fibre-rich and fermented foods that support digestion, and outlines dietary habits that disrupt gut balance. The piece emphasises that consistent, informed eating habits are key to maintaining a healthy gut.",
        content: `<h2 data-start="202" data-end="217">Introduction</h2>
    <p data-start="219" data-end="564">Have you ever eaten a meal and felt bloated, tired, or uncomfortable shortly after? You are not alone. Many people experience digestive issues daily without realising that their food choices may be the cause. According to research, about 70% of the immune system lives in the gut, and the foods we eat play a major role in how well it functions.</p>
    <p data-start="566" data-end="913">Gut health starts with simple, informed choices. The gut does more than digest food. It influences immunity, metabolism, and even mental wellbeing. Understanding how food affects gut health can help you make better choices for your body, every single day. In this article, ride with me and let me show you how daily food choices affect gut health.</p>
    <h2 data-start="920" data-end="953">What Does Gut Microbiome Mean?</h2>
    <p data-start="955" data-end="1113">The gut microbiome consists of trillions of microorganisms. These include helpful bacteria and potentially harmful ones. They live inside the digestive tract.</p>
    <p data-start="1115" data-end="1418">When the gut microbiome is balanced, it supports digestion, nutrient absorption, and immune defence. When this balance is disturbed, a condition called dysbiosis occurs. Dysbiosis can lead to digestive discomfort and other health problems. One of the strongest factors that affects this balance is diet.</p>
    <h2 data-start="1425" data-end="1457">Foods That Enhance Gut Health</h2>
    <h3 data-start="1459" data-end="1476">Dietary fibre</h3>
    <p data-start="1478" data-end="1710">Dietary fibre plays a key role in feeding beneficial gut bacteria. Fibre is found in vegetables such as spinach, cabbage, lettuce, and water leaf. It is also found in fruits like oranges, bananas, apples, pineapples, and watermelon.</p>
    <p data-start="1712" data-end="1865">Legumes such as beans, soybeans, and guinea corn are good sources of fibre. Nuts like groundnuts, cashew nuts, walnuts, and flaxseeds also provide fibre.</p>
    <p data-start="1867" data-end="1967">Whole grains such as rice, oats, barley, whole wheat, millet, and sorghum are rich in fibre as well.</p>
    <p data-start="1969" data-end="2104">Gut bacteria ferment fibre and produce short-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids help maintain the gut lining and reduce inflammation.</p>
    <h3 data-start="2106" data-end="2125">Fermented foods</h3>
    <p data-start="2127" data-end="2398">Fermented foods introduce beneficial bacteria into the gut. Examples include yoghurt, cheese, fermented vegetables like kimchi and sauerkraut, pap, and kefir. Regular consumption of fermented foods has been linked to better digestion and improved gut microbial diversity.</p>
    <h2 data-start="2405" data-end="2458">Dietary Habits That May Interfere With Gut Balance</h2>
    <p data-start="2460" data-end="2509">Some eating habits can harm gut health over time.</p>
    <p data-start="2511" data-end="2619">Excessive intake of refined foods such as bagels, buns, cakes, and doughnuts can reduce beneficial bacteria.</p>
    <p data-start="2621" data-end="2762">Ultra-processed carbohydrates like instant noodles, frozen pizzas, fast-food burgers, and fries can encourage the growth of harmful microbes.</p>
    <p data-start="2764" data-end="2879">Added sugars found in sodas, soft drinks, candies, chocolates, and sweetened fruit juices also disrupt gut balance.</p>
    <p data-start="2881" data-end="3022">High alcohol intake damages the gut barrier and alters microbial composition. This increases the risk of inflammation and digestive problems.</p>
    <h2 data-start="3029" data-end="3059">Gut Health Beyond Digestion</h2>
    <p data-start="3061" data-end="3261">The gut is important for more than digestion alone. Research shows strong links between gut health, immunity, mental health, and metabolism. This connection is often referred to as the gut&ndash;brain axis.</p>
    <p data-start="3263" data-end="3582">Poor gut health can weaken the immune system. It can also affect mood, energy levels, and metabolic health. Common signs of poor gut health include bloating, constipation, fatigue, weakened immunity, and mood changes. Being intentional about food choices helps maintain microbial balance and supports overall wellbeing.</p>
    <h2 data-start="3589" data-end="3604">Key Takeaway</h2>
    <p data-start="3606" data-end="3862">Gut health is shaped by daily habits, not short-term actions. Eating more fibre-rich foods such as vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains supports a healthy gut. Including fermented foods like yoghurt, pap, cheese, and sauerkraut is also beneficial.</p>
    <p data-start="3864" data-end="4120">Maintaining dietary variety and reducing highly processed foods such as instant noodles, cakes, doughnuts, burgers, pizzas, bagels, and buns can greatly improve gut health. Consistent, informed food choices support not only digestion but overall wellbeing.</p>

It explains ketosis, highlights the risks of extreme carbohydrate restriction, and stresses that healthy weight loss comes from calorie control, balance, and professional guidance. The story reinforces that sustainable results require gradual, informed dietary changes—not starvation or internet trends.",
        content: `<h2 data-start="193" data-end="208">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p data-start="210" data-end="417">The keto diet, short for ketogenic diet, is a very low-carb, high-fat, moderate-protein eating plan that forces the body into a metabolic state called ketosis, where it burns fat for fuel instead of glucose.</p>
<h2 data-start="424" data-end="455">Folashade&rsquo;s Weight Obsession</h2>
<p data-start="457" data-end="576">&ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t like how I look?&rdquo; Folashade said as she turned and moved in front of the mirror, stepping on the scale.</p>
<p data-start="578" data-end="819">&ldquo;Fola, did you even research this keto thing before you started it?&rdquo; I said, moving closer to the mirror to read the scale. &ldquo;I doubt it&rsquo;s healthy to lose this much weight in a week. You don&rsquo;t even look good, babes,&rdquo; I said, looking at her.</p>
<p data-start="821" data-end="988">&ldquo;Abeggi, Nife, what is there to research? The link I saw said to remove carbohydrates. Is that not all?&rdquo; She stepped off the scale to sit. &ldquo;Please, I&rsquo;m dizzy, abeg.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-start="990" data-end="1082">&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re dizzy when you&rsquo;re starving yourself. Please, I&rsquo;m ordering food for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-start="1084" data-end="1217">She followed me as I stood up. &ldquo;Nife, you know I&rsquo;ve never felt beautiful being fat. Can&rsquo;t you just support me on this?&rdquo; she begged.</p>
<p data-start="1219" data-end="1337">&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t. Our friend is a literal dietitian. Let&rsquo;s call her and hear what she has to say about this keto drama.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-start="1339" data-end="1409">&ldquo;Hello, Derinsola, What&rsquo;s up? How&rsquo;s work? Hope you&rsquo;re not too busy?&rdquo;</p>
<p data-start="1411" data-end="1463">&ldquo;No, my love. Hope everything&rsquo;s fine. How&rsquo;s Fola?&rdquo;</p>
<p data-start="1465" data-end="1662">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m calling sef. She&rsquo;s here, and she&rsquo;s starving herself with one keto drama to lose weight, talking about &lsquo;don&rsquo;t eat carbohydrates.&rsquo; Please explain to her that she&rsquo;s harming herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-start="1664" data-end="2004">&ldquo;Ah, Fola, you could have just called me. See, Fola, weight loss isn&rsquo;t by starving. It&rsquo;s by calorie deficit and portion control. Completely removing carbohydrates is totally unnecessary and can be harmful, as it is the body&rsquo;s preferred energy source. Forcing your body out of its natural state suddenly will only harm you in the process.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-start="2006" data-end="2081">&ldquo;Help me tell her, oh,&rdquo; I retort, looking at Fola as she lowers her head.</p>
<p data-start="2083" data-end="2490">&ldquo;The keto diet has its ups and downs. Restrictive diets like that aren&rsquo;t for everyone. That&rsquo;s why you should have asked me. I&rsquo;d have helped you understand. Besides, I hope you know healthy weight loss is like 0.5 to 1 kg per week to allow your body to get used to the breakdown. Not what you&rsquo;re doing now. You&rsquo;re just wasting muscle, and you&rsquo;ll fall sick at this rate. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re dizzy and feverish.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-start="2492" data-end="2559">&ldquo;7 kg in one week. If you look at her, you&rsquo;ll think she&rsquo;s dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-start="2561" data-end="3134">&ldquo;No na. You don&rsquo;t just stop eating carbohydrates or start skipping meals. You need to gradually start reducing your calorie amount, and you may not even need to eat less. That&rsquo;s where your dietitian comes in to help you curate that plan. Fola, don&rsquo;t just believe everything you see on the internet. Let me tell you, I hope you know the moment you stop this keto diet, your body will start gathering fat all over again because it&rsquo;s not a diet you can keep up for long. Gradual change is the route to long-term success. Keto isn&rsquo;t bad, but you need proper guidance for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-start="3136" data-end="3230">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re saying I can eat rice, bread, and swallow and lose weight?&rdquo; Fola grabs the phone.</p>
<p data-start="3232" data-end="3346">&ldquo;Yes, Fola, you can. You guys can come in tomorrow for a proper consultation and a diet plan. It&rsquo;s not free, o.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-start="3348" data-end="3401">&ldquo;Yes, ma,&rdquo; Fola says, laughing, as we end the call.</p>
<p data-start="3403" data-end="3499">&ldquo;You see, life is not hard.&rdquo; My phone dings. &ldquo;Our food is here. Let&rsquo;s go and meet the driver.&rdquo;</p>

        summary:
            "This article explains why nutrition should begin before conception and remain a priority throughout pregnancy. It outlines increased nutritional needs, dispels the myth of “eating for two,” and highlights essential macronutrients and micronutrients required for healthy fetal development. The piece emphasises balanced diets, appropriate weight gain, and nutrition education to support positive maternal and pregnancy outcomes.",
        content: `<p data-start="184" data-end="326">Life begins after the successful implantation of a fertilized ovum into the uterus. An important question is: <strong data-start="294" data-end="326">When should nutrition begin?</strong></p>
<p data-start="328" data-end="844">Health and dietary preparation should start at least three months before conception to prepare the body for pregnancy. This is crucial because fetal development begins immediately after fertilization, often before a woman even knows she is pregnant. Poor maternal nutrition can have long-term consequences on the fetus and may affect pregnancy outcomes, including increasing the risk of dietary-related non-communicable diseases. Simply put, a malnourished mother is more likely to give birth to a malnourished baby.</p>
<p data-start="846" data-end="1173">Pregnancy is a unique physiological period with increased nutritional demands to support fetal growth and maternal health. Optimal nutrition is not about &ldquo;eating for two&rdquo; in quantity but rather &ldquo;eating twice as well&rdquo; in quality. The idea of eating double portions is a myth; instead, the focus should be on nutrient-rich foods.</p>
<p data-start="1175" data-end="1690">Physiological changes during pregnancy, such as increased blood volume, a higher basal metabolic rate, hormonal shifts, and the development of the placenta and fetus, increase the body&rsquo;s nutrient requirements. Energy needs rise gradually, with an additional ~340 calories per day in the second trimester and ~450 calories per day in the third trimester when fetal growth is fastest. No extra calories are typically required during the first trimester, though emphasis on nutrient-dense foods can help manage nausea.</p>
<h2 data-start="1697" data-end="1719">Essential Nutrients</h2>
<h3 data-start="1721" data-end="1742">1. Macronutrients</h3>
<p data-start="1744" data-end="1971"><strong data-start="1744" data-end="1762">Carbohydrates:</strong><br data-start="1762" data-end="1765" /> Provide energy and maintain blood glucose levels. Complex carbohydrates from whole grains, fruits, and vegetables are preferred, while excessive refined sugars may increase the risk of gestational diabetes.</p>
<p data-start="1973" data-end="2157"><strong data-start="1973" data-end="1986">Proteins:</strong><br data-start="1986" data-end="1989" /> Essential for fetal tissue, maternal organs, and placental development. Inadequate intake can impair fetal growth. Sources include meat, fish, eggs, legumes, and dairy.</p>
<p data-start="2159" data-end="2277"><strong data-start="2159" data-end="2168">Fats:</strong><br data-start="2168" data-end="2171" /> Especially omega-3 fatty acids, support fetal brain and eye development. Unhealthy fats should be limited.</p>
<h3 data-start="2279" data-end="2300">2. Micronutrients</h3>
<p data-start="2302" data-end="2463"><strong data-start="2302" data-end="2311">Iron:</strong><br data-start="2311" data-end="2314" /> Needed for increased maternal blood volume and fetal needs, preventing anemia, fatigue, and poor pregnancy outcomes. Recommended daily intake: 27 mg.</p>
<p data-start="2465" data-end="2557"><strong data-start="2465" data-end="2480">Folic acid:</strong><br data-start="2480" data-end="2483" /> Crucial for DNA synthesis and cell division; prevents neural tube defects.</p>
<p data-start="2559" data-end="2710"><strong data-start="2559" data-end="2585">Calcium and Vitamin D:</strong><br data-start="2585" data-end="2588" /> Calcium supports maternal and fetal bone health and may prevent preeclampsia, while vitamin D enhances calcium absorption.</p>
<p data-start="2712" data-end="2839"><strong data-start="2712" data-end="2723">Iodine:</strong><br data-start="2723" data-end="2726" /> Necessary for thyroid hormone production and fetal brain development; deficiency can impair growth and cognition.</p>
<p data-start="2846" data-end="3110">Appropriate weight gain is essential for healthy pregnancy outcomes. Both insufficient and excessive weight gain can lead to complications such as intrauterine growth restriction or fetal macrosomia. The focus should be on adequate, balanced meals, not overeating.</p>
<p data-start="3112" data-end="3378">Challenges to proper nutrition include nausea, vomiting, food cravings or aversions, cultural taboos, and, in developing countries, limited access to nutritious foods. Nutrition education and antenatal supplementation are key strategies to overcome these challenges.</p>
<h2 data-start="3385" data-end="3398">Conclusion</h2>
<p data-start="3400" data-end="3708">Good nutrition during pregnancy is essential for maternal and fetal health. A balanced diet rich in macronutrients and micronutrients, along with proper supplementation and education, supports healthy fetal development, reduces pregnancy complications, and promotes lifelong health for both mother and child.</p>

<p data-start="1032" data-end="1352">Information flow both directions: your brain sends signals that affect digestion but your gut also sends crucial messages back to the brain that influence your mood, focus and mental clarity. When you're stressed about final year project, your stomach churns and when you do not feed your stomach, you brain feels foggy.</p>
<p data-start="1354" data-end="1594">Here is where it gets interesting. Your gut houses trillions of bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms collectively called &ldquo;micro-biomes&rdquo; and these tiny organisms are influencing everything from your immune system to your emotional state.</p>
<p data-start="1596" data-end="1915">Your gut bacteria actually produce neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers that regulate mood and cognition. In fact, approximately 90% of your body's serotonin (often called the "happy chemical") is produced in your gut not your brain. Your micro-biome also manufactures dopamine which affects motivation and focus.</p>
<p data-start="1917" data-end="2057">Every time you eat, you're feeding your micro-biome and it creates an environment in your gut that directly impacts your mental performance.</p>
<p data-start="2064" data-end="2317">High-sugar foods cause rapid spikes and crashes in blood glucose, leading to brain fog, irritability, and poor concentration. That afternoon energy drink might give you a temporary boost but the subsequent crash can leave you more scattered than before.</p>
<p data-start="2319" data-end="2657">Ultra-processed foods lack the fiber and nutrients that beneficial gut bacteria need to thrive. When good bacteria starve, harmful bacteria can take over producing compounds that increase inflammation throughout your body, including your brain. Research has linked this inflammation to increased anxiety, depression and cognitive decline.</p>
<p data-start="2659" data-end="2923">Excessive alcohol consumption particularly binge drinking common in the university, damages the gut lining and disrupts the micro-biome balance. This can lead to a "leaky gut" where toxins and inflammatory compounds enter the bloodstream and affect brain function.</p>
<p data-start="2930" data-end="3107">The good news is that you have the power to support your gut-brain connection with every meal. You don't need an expensive meal plan or exotic supplements, just smarter choices.</p>
<p data-start="3109" data-end="3328">Fermented foods like yogurt, fermented pap, ogiri etc. contain live beneficial bacteria (probiotics) that can colonize your gut and support mental clarity. Adding just one serving daily can make a measurable difference.</p>
<p data-start="3330" data-end="3598">Fiber-rich foods act as "prebiotics&rdquo; or simply food for the live beneficial bacteria in your gut. Oats, beans, berries and vegetables help beneficial microbes flourish. Students who increase their fiber intake often report improved mood and concentration within weeks.</p>
<p data-start="3600" data-end="3796">Omega-3 fatty acids from fatty fish (sardines), walnuts etc. reduces inflammation and support the production of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein crucial for learning and memory.</p>
<p data-start="3798" data-end="3922">Dark leafy greens like spinach provide magnesium a nutrient essential for neurotransmitter production and stress management.</p>
<p data-start="3929" data-end="4033">You don't need to overhaul your entire diet overnight. Small, consistent changes create lasting results.</p>
<p data-start="4035" data-end="4197">Swap sugary cereal for yogurt with a handful of nuts. This combination provides probiotics, fiber, protein and healthy fats support focus through morning classes.</p>
<p data-start="4199" data-end="4296">Stay hydrated, dehydration impairs cognitive function and mood. Keep a water bottle close to you.</p>
<p data-start="4298" data-end="4446">Snack smarter, replace chips with vegetables, fruit slices or small handful of mixed nuts. These options provide sustained energy without the crash.</p>
<h2 data-start="4453" data-end="4471">The Bottom Line</h2>
<p data-start="4473" data-end="4684">Your gut and brain are in constant conversation, what you eat matters and the anxiety or difficulty concentrating that you may attribute to stress or lack of sleep could be significantly influenced by your diet.</p>
<p data-start="4686" data-end="4796">Your brain is your most valuable academic asset. It's time to start nourishing the gut that helps it function.</p>

<p data-start="4803" data-end="5093"><strong data-start="4803" data-end="4812">Note:</strong> While dietary changes can significantly impact mental health and cognitive function, they're not a substitute for professional medical or mental health care. If you're experiencing persistent anxiety, depression or other mental health concerns, reach out to a healthcare provider.</p>

            "This article explores how poor diet affects everyday health in subtle but meaningful ways. It explains how low-quality nutrition contributes to fatigue, weakened immunity, poor concentration, digestive issues, and mood changes. The piece highlights that long-term health risks often begin with these quiet daily signals and emphasises simple dietary improvements to support overall wellbeing.",
        content: `<h2 data-start="184" data-end="199">Introduction</h2>
<p data-start="201" data-end="644">Many people believe that a poor diet only leads to visible problems like obesity or severe malnutrition. In reality, the effects of what we eat or fail to eat often appear quietly in our everyday lives. Constant tiredness, frequent illnesses, poor concentration, and mood changes are commonly blamed on stress or lack of sleep, but diet plays a powerful and often overlooked role. Poor nutrition does not always shout; most times, it whispers.</p>
<h2 data-start="651" data-end="685">Low Energy and Constant Fatigue</h2>
<p data-start="687" data-end="1085">One of the earliest signs of a poor diet is persistent low energy. Diets high in refined carbohydrates, sugary drinks, and ultra-processed foods cause quick energy spikes followed by sudden crashes. When meals lack essential nutrients such as iron, B-vitamins, and complex carbohydrates, the body struggles to produce energy efficiently. As a result, people may feel tired even after adequate rest.</p>
<h2 data-start="1092" data-end="1133">Weakened Immunity and Frequent Illness</h2>
<p data-start="1135" data-end="1469">A diet low in fruits, vegetables, and quality protein can weaken the immune system. Nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin A, zinc, and protein are essential for immune function. When these nutrients are insufficient, the body becomes more vulnerable to infections, leading to frequent colds, slow wound healing, and longer recovery times.</p>
<h2 data-start="1476" data-end="1514">Poor Concentration and Mood Changes</h2>
<p data-start="1516" data-end="1908">The brain relies on a steady supply of nutrients such as glucose, omega-3 fatty acids, iron, and B-vitamins to function properly. Skipping meals or consuming nutrient poor foods can affect memory, focus, and decision-making. Poor diet has also been linked to mood swings, irritability, and symptoms of anxiety and depression, highlighting the strong connection between food and mental health.</p>
<h2 data-start="1915" data-end="1955">Digestive Problems and Gut Discomfort</h2>
<p data-start="1957" data-end="2279">Low fiber intake common in diets dominated by refined foods can lead to constipation, bloating, and poor gut health. Dietary fiber from whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes supports digestion and promotes healthy gut bacteria. An unhealthy gut can negatively affect immunity, inflammation, and overall well-being.</p>
<h2 data-start="2286" data-end="2311">Long-Term Health Risks</h2>
<p data-start="2313" data-end="2618">Although the daily effects of poor diet may seem mild, long-term unhealthy eating patterns increase the risk of chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and micronutrient deficiencies. These conditions often develop slowly and may remain unnoticed until they become severe.</p>
<h2 data-start="2625" data-end="2649">Conclusion / Takeaway</h2>
<p data-start="2651" data-end="3126">Poor diet affects everyday health in subtle but significant ways. Persistent fatigue, poor concentration, frequent illness, and low mood may be signs that the body needs better nutrition. Simple changes such as increasing fruit and vegetable intake, choosing whole foods, and reducing ultra-processed foods can greatly improve daily health and overall quality of life. Good nutrition is not only about preventing disease; it is about feeling and functioning better every day.</p>
